    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#In NumPy, both `np.mean()` and `np.average()` calculate the average of an array, but they differ in functionality and flexibility. `np.mean()` calculates the arithmetic mean of an array along a specified axis, giving equal weight to each element, and is simpler to use when all values contribute equally. In contrast, `np.average()` allows for optional weighting of elements, where a `weights` parameter can assign different importance to each value, making it useful when some data points should have more influence in the average. If you need a straightforward mean, `np.mean()` is ideal, but if the context requires weighted data (e.g., in surveys or experiments with varying significance of data points), `np.average()` provides the needed flexibility."

    "#Q3 Describe the methods for reversing a NumPy array along different axes. Provide examples for 1D and 2D arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "# To reverse a NumPy array along different axes, slicing with negative steps (`[::-1]`) is a common method. For a 1D array, reversing can be done simply with `arr[::-1]`, which inverts the order of elements. For 2D arrays, reversing along rows is achieved with `arr[::-1, :]`, flipping the order of rows, while reversing along columns is done with `arr[:, ::-1]`, flipping the order of columns. To reverse both dimensions, use `arr[::-1, ::-1]`, which will invert both rows and columns. For example, if `arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])`, `arr[::-1]` results in `[3, 2, 1]`. For a 2D array `arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])`, `arr[::-1, :]` gives `[[3, 4], [1, 2]]` and `arr[:, ::-1]` results in `[[2, 1], [4, 3]]`."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# To determine the data type of elements in a NumPy array, you can use the `dtype` attribute, accessed with `array.dtype`. This reveals the specific data type (e.g., `int32`, `float64`) of the array’s elements. Understanding data types in NumPy is crucial for memory management and performance because each data type occupies a specific amount of memory. For instance, an `int32` type uses 4 bytes per element, while `float64` uses 8 bytes, meaning that larger data types increase memory consumption. By selecting an appropriate data type based on data precision needs, you can minimize memory usage, which is especially important for large datasets. Additionally, using simpler data types like `int32` or `float32` over `float64` can speed up computations, as operations on smaller data types are generally faster. Effective data type selection allows NumPy to handle large data efficiently, contributing to optimized performance in scientific and data-intensive applications."

    "\n",
    "# In NumPy, `ndarray` (n-dimensional array) is a powerful data structure used for storing and manipulating homogeneous, multi-dimensional data. Unlike standard Python lists, which can contain mixed data types and are limited in performance, `ndarrays` store elements of the same data type in a contiguous block of memory, allowing for faster access and efficient mathematical operations. Key features of `ndarrays` include support for multi-dimensional arrays (1D, 2D, and beyond), efficient broadcasting capabilities (where smaller arrays are expanded to match larger arrays for element-wise operations), and an extensive library of mathematical functions optimized for these arrays. Additionally, `ndarrays` offer slicing, indexing, and reshaping capabilities that enable complex data manipulations with concise code. This design allows `ndarrays` to be highly performant for numerical computations compared to Python lists, which are not optimized for such operations and lack advanced array-handling features like broadcasting."

    "# NumPy arrays offer significant performance benefits over Python lists for large-scale numerical operations due to their memory efficiency and computational optimizations. Unlike Python lists, which store elements as individual Python objects with additional overhead, NumPy arrays store data in a compact, contiguous memory block, allowing for faster access and less memory usage. This structure enables efficient element-wise operations without the need for looping through each element, as NumPy leverages low-level C and Fortran libraries that are optimized for vectorized operations. As a result, mathematical operations on NumPy arrays can be performed much faster than on Python lists, especially when handling large datasets. Additionally, NumPy arrays support broadcasting, which allows operations to be applied across different array shapes without extra copying, further reducing the computational load. These advantages make NumPy arrays ideal for tasks in data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing, where performance and memory efficiency are critical."
